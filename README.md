# Identifying-Customer-Segments

•	Applied unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers for a mail-order company using demographic and spending data from a sample of German households

•	Built a data preprocessing pipeline using data imputation and data encoding techniques

•	Implemented PCA to reduce the dimensionality and extract new features of highest variance

•	Clustered the customer data and the general population data using K-means

•	Identified the segments of the population forming the core customer base by comparing the distribution of people by cluster for the customer data to the general population data
